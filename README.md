code-samples
============

Some random code samples that may be useful.

1. count-triangles : Quickly count number of triangles in a large (sparse) graph

2. nnet-cifar10 : Simple neural network implementation for a class project. 
	Achieves 56% accuracy on CIFR-10 with 30 mins training time.

3. convNet-cifar100 : Simple convolutional neural network using tensorflow.
	Achieves 40% accuracy on CIFAR-100 with 30 mins training time.
